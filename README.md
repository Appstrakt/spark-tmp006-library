TMP006 Library for Spark Core
===================
Honeywell HumidIconTM Digital Humidity/Temperature Sensors: HIH6130/6131 and 6120/6121 Series is a digital output-type relative humidity (RH) and temperature sensor combined in the same package. The library uses I2C to connect to the sensor (see the Wire library). ***SPI can also be used, but is not implemented in this library***.
